*Drone it* is a little web synth that I made by three reasons:

* My love for music (and synths :))
* My love for web
* My purpose of made a *no JS framework* project after a while, so I can practice the basics and fundaments

## Technologies used

*Drone it* is made with JS, HTML and CSS. 
I used Tone.js lib for make the synth engine, but all the UI logic and values/parameters to send to and control the synth are controlled by vanilla JS :)
